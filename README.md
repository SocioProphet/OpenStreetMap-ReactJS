# Open Street Map with React JS

A simple project I built at a hackathon. Learnt the basics of React JS. This web app displays an Open Street Map using [React Leaflet](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet). The goal was to connect this web app to the Realtime Firebase Database to show pins on the map. Use your own Firebase credentials to run the project.

To start, clone the repository on your machine and run `npm start`.
